# Shattered Relics Fragment Presets plugin

This is a quick, dirty plugin to add presets to fragments in Leagues III. Since we can't write plugins that send actions to servers, this plugin will instead scroll you automatically to your fragments presets-by-one until they're all equipped.

This isn't my best code, but I wanted to get back to playing Leagues, so I stopped trying to make it prettier. Don't learn from this!
